# About

This Project is part of my web development journey in doing freelance web development starting at 0 funding.

All that I am equipped is the ability to code and try to raise funds so I can take my family to Japan or somewhere cold.

## This Project

This side of the project is part of my portfolio building series where I use what tools I have to launch and this part looks at using Github as a CMS using the discussions.

There are two parts to this project.

Use Github as a cms to host a blog. Where I provide tutorials on how the project is set up.

## Part 2

Use it to showcase a portfolio combined with Github pages.
